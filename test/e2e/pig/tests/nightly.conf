# SUB    : CastScalar
# FEATURE: adds functionality that allows to cast elements of a single-tuple relation into a scalar value.
# JIRA: Pig-1434 
#
# TEST ITEMS:
# 1 Test syntax
# 2 Test scalar for simple data type
# 3 Test scalar for complex data type: tuple, bag, map
# 4 Test implicit cast
# 5 Test explicit cast
# 6 Positional parameter
# 7 Cast within an aggregate function
# 8 Cast within an UDF function
# 9 Cast with a FOREACH
# 10 Cast with a FILTER
# 11 Cast with a SPLIT
# 12 Cast in a JOIN
# 13 Multiquery
# 14 Cast on a schema that cannot be inferred should result in bytearray
# 15 Replicated Join
# 16 Test operations such as R1 * (int)R1
# 17 CheckSingular(*)
# 18 missing field in scalar file
# 19 scalar referenced from an empty file
# 20 empty input directory
# 21 Single row vs Multiple Row
# 22 Cast on a multi-field tuple
# 23 Reference a non-scalar as a scalar
# 24 Test multiple loaders
