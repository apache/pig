   <title>Embedded Pig - Python and JavaScript </title>
   
<p>To enable control flow, you can embed Pig Latin scripts in a host scripting language via a JDBC-like compile, bind, run model. This section discusses Python (via Jython) and JavaScript (via Rhino). You must make sure that the Jython jar and/or the Rhino jar are included in your class path if you want to used embedded Pig. At runtime Pig will automatically detect the usage of a scripting UDF in the Pig script and will ship the corresponding scripting jar to the backend.</p>  

<p>Note: Currently, more Python than JavaScript examples are shown below.</p>
   
   <section>
   <title>Invocation Basics</title>
<p>Embedded Pig Latin is supported in batch mode only, not interactive mode. You can request that embedded Pig Latin be used by adding the <code>--embedded</code> option to the Pig command line. If this option is passed as an argument, that argument will refer to the language Pig Latin is embedded in, either Python or JavaScript. If no argument is specified, it is taken to refer to the reference implementation for Python.</p>


 <p><strong>Python</strong></p>
 <source>
 $ pig myembedded.py
OR
$ java -cp &lt;jython jars&gt;:&lt;pig jars&gt;; [--embedded python] /tmp/myembedded.py
 </source>
 <p></p>
 <p>Pig will look for the <code>#!/usr/bin/python</code> line in the script.</p>
 
  <source>
#!/usr/bin/python 

# explicitly import Pig class 
from org.apache.pig.scripting import Pig 

# COMPILE: compile method returns a Pig object that represents the pipeline
P = Pig.compile("a = load '$in'; store a into '$out';")

input = 'original'
output = 'output'

# BIND and RUN 
result = P.bind({'in':input, 'out':output}).runSingle()

if result.isSuccessful() :
    print 'Pig job succeeded'
else :
    raise 'Pig job failed'
 </source>

<p><strong>JavaScript</strong></p>
<source>
$ pig myembedded.js
OR
$ java -cp &lt;rhino jars&gt;:&lt;pig jars&gt;; [--embedded javascript] /tmp/myembedded.js
</source>
<p></p>
<p>Pig will look for the *.js extension in the script.</p>
<source>
importPackage(Packages.org.apache.pig.scripting.js) 

Pig = org.apache.pig.scripting.js.JSPig

function main() {
    input = "original"
    output = "output"

    P = Pig.compile("A = load '$in'; store A into '$out';") 

    result = P.bind({'in':input, 'out':output}).runSingle() 

    if (result.isSuccessful()) {
        print("Pig job succeeded")
    } else {
        print("Pig job failed")
    }   
}
</source>

<p><strong>Invocation Process</strong></p>

<p>You invoke Pig Latin in the host scripting language through an embedded <a href="#pig-Object">Pig object</a>. </p>  

<p><strong>Compile:</strong> Compile is a static function on the Pig object and in its simplest form takes a fragment of Pig Latin that defines the pipeline as its input:</p>  

<source>
# COMPILE: complie method returns a Pig object that represents the pipeline
P = Pig.compile("""A = load '$in’; store A into '$out’;""")
</source>

<p>Compile returns an instance of Pig object. This object can have certain values undefined. For example, you may want to define a pipeline without yet specifying the location of the input to the pipeline. The parameter will be indicated by a dollar sign followed by a sequence of alpha-numeric or underscore characters. Values for these parameters must be provided later at the time bind() is called on the Pig object. To call run() on a Pig object without all parameters being bound is an error. </p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Bind:</strong> Resolve the parameters during the bind call.</p>

<source>
input = "original”
output = "output”

# BIND: bind method binds the variables with the parameters in the pipeline and returns a BoundScript object
Q = P.bind({'in':input, 'out':output}) 
</source>

<p>Please note that all parameters must be resolved during bind. Having unbound parameters while running your script is an error. Also note that even if your script is fully defined during compile, bind without parameters still must be called.</p>

<p><strong>Run:</strong> Bind call returns an instance of <a href="#BoundScript-Object">BoundScript object</a> that can be used to execute the pipeline. The simplest way to execute the pipeline is to call runSingle function. (However, as mentioned later, this works only if  a single set of variables is bound to the parameters. Otherwise, if multiple set of variables are bound, an exception will be thrown if runSingle is called.)</p>

<source>

result = Q.runSingle()
</source>

<p>The function returns a <a href="#PigStats-Object">PigStats object</a> that tells you whether the run succeeded or failed. In case of success, additional run statistics are provided.</p>


<p><strong>Embedded Python Example</strong></p>
<p>A complete embedded example is shown below.</p>
<source>

#! /usr/bin/python

# explicitly import Pig class from org.apache.pig.scripting import Pig

# COMPILE: compile method returns a Pig object that represents the pipeline
P = Pig.compile("""A = load '$in’; store A into '$out’;""")

input = "original”
output = "output”

# BIND: bind method binds the variables with the parameters in the pipeline and returns a BoundScript object
Q = P.bind({'in':input, 'out':output}) 

# In this case, only one set of variables is bound to the pipeline, runSingle method returns a PigStats object. 
# If multiple sets of variables are bound to the pipeline, run method instead must be called and it returns 
# a list of PigStats objects.
result = Q.runSingle()

# check the result
if result.isSuccessful():
    print "Pig job succeeded"
else:
    raise "Pig job failed"    


OR, SIMPLY DO THIS:


#! /usr/bin/python

# explicitly import Pig class from org.apache.pig.scripting import Pig

in = "original”
out = "output”

# implicitly bind the parameters to the local variables 
result= Pig.compile("""A = load '$in’; store A into '$out’;""").bind().runSingle() 

if result.isSuccessful():
    print "Pig job succeeded"
else:
    raise "Pig job failed"
</source>
</section> 


<section>
<title>Invocation Details</title>
<p>All three APIs (compile, bind, run) discussed in the previous section have several versions depending on what you are trying to do.</p>

<section>
<title>Compile</title>
<p>In its basic form, compile just takes a Pig Latin Fragment that defines the pipeline as described in the previous section. Additionally, the pipeline can be given a name. This name is only used when the embedded script is invoked via the PigRunner Java API (as discussed later in this document).</p>

<source>

 P = Pig.compile(“P1”, """A = load '$in’; store A into '$out’;""")
</source>

<p>In addition to providing Pig script via a string, you can store it in a file and pass the file to the compile call:</p>
<source>

P = Pig.compileFromFile("myscript.pig”)
</source>

<p>You can also name a pipeline stored in the script:</p>
<source>

P = Pig.compileFromFile(“P2”, "myscript.pig”)
</source>
</section>


<section>
<title>Bind</title>
<p>In its simplest form, bind takes no parameters. In this case, an implicit bind is performed; Pig internally constructs a map of parameters from the local variables specified by the user in the script.</p>

<source>

Q = P.bind () 
</source>

<p>In the case where parameter substitution is needed, a map of parameters (parameter name &gt; parameter value) must be provided as was illustrated in the example above.</p>

<p>Finally, you might want to run the same pipeline in parallel with a different set of parameters, for instance for multiple dates. In this case, bind function, needs to be passed a list of maps with each element of the list containing parameters for a single invocation. In the example below, the pipeline is run for the US, the UK, and Brazil.</p>

<source>
P = Pig.compile("""A = load '$in';
                   B = filter A by user is not null;
                   ...
                   store Z into '$out';
                """)

Q = P.bind([{'in':'us_raw','out':'us_processed'},
        {'in':'uk_raw','out':'uk_processed'},
        {'in':'brazil_raw','out':'brazil_processed'}])

results = Q.run() # it blocks until all pipelines are completed

for i in [0, 1, 2]:
    result = results[i]
    ... # check result for each pipeline

</source>
</section>

<section>
<title>Run</title>

<p>We have already seen that the simplest way to run a script is to call runSingle without any parameters. Additionally, a Java Properties object and or file containing a list of properties can be passed to this call. The properties are passed to Pig and a treated as any other properties passed from command line.</p>

<source>

// In a jython script 

from java.util import Properties
... ...

props = Properties()
props.put(key1, val1)  
props.put(key2, val2) 
... ... 

Pig.compile(...).bind(...).runSingle(props)
</source>
<p>A more general version of run allows to run one or more pipelines concurrently. In this case, a list of PigStats results is returned – one for each pipeline run. The example above shows how to make use of this call.</p>
<p>As the case with runSingle, a set of Java Properties or a property file can be passed to the call.</p>
</section>

</section> 

<section>
<title>Embedded Pig and Pig Runner API</title>

<p>Starting with Pig 0.8, some applications such as Oozie workflow invoke Pig using the PigRunner Java class rather than through the command line. For these applications, the PigRunner interface has been expanded to accommodate embedding. PigRunner now can accept a Jython script as input. This script can potentially contain multiple Pig pipelines; therefore, we need a way to return results for all of them.</p>

<p>To do this and to preserve backward compatibility PigStats and related objects were expanded as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>getAllStats() and List getAllErrorMessages() were added to the PigStats class. The map returned from getAllStats is keyed on the name of the pipeline provided in the compile call. If the name was not compiled an internally generated id would be used. </li>
<li>PigStats is now an abstract class with a new abstract method isEmbedded().   </li>
<li>Two new classes that extend PigStats were created: SimplePigStats and EmbeddedPigStats. PigStats as it is today will become SimplePigStats. SimplePigStats.getAllStats() will return null. EmbeddedPigStats will return null for methods not listed in the proposal below. </li>
<li>The PigProgressNotificationListener interface was modified to add script id to all its methods.  </li>
</ul>

<p>For more details of the changes, see <a href="#Java+Objects">Java Objects</a>.</p>

</section> 


<section>
<title>Embedded Pig and Scripting UDFs</title>

<p>Pig 0.8 introduced support for user defined functions (UDFs) written in Python. An example of adding those UDFs in Pig Latin is:</p>
<p><code>Register 'test.py' using jython as myfuncs;</code></p>

<p>An embedded Pig script (written in a scripting language such as Jython) contains definitions of Pig pipelines as well as control flow code to run these pipelines. There are two ways you can support UDFs (written in the same scripting language) in an embedded Pig script: </p>

<ul>
<li>Register the UDFs as part of pipeline definition -  In this case, the UDFs are only available to the pipeline. </li>
<li>Use the registerUDF method on Pig object - In this case, the UDFs are available for all the pipelines defined in the script file. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><code>Pig.registerUDF('test.py', 'myfuncs')</code></p>
</section> 



<section>
<title>Usage Examples</title>

<section>
<title>Pig Script Files in Scripting Language</title>
<p>Rather than specifying individual Pig Latin statements, you can import an entire Pig script. </p>

<source>
#! /usr/bin/python

from org.apache.pig.scripting import Pig

P = Pig.compileFromFile("""myscript.pig""")

input = "original”
output = "output”

result = p.bind({'in':input, 'out':output}).runSingle()
if result.isSuccessful():
    print "Pig job succeeded"
else:
    raise "Pig job failed" 
</source>
</section> 

<section>
<title>Convergence</title>
<p>There is a class of problems that involve iterating over a data pipeline an indeterminate number of times until a certain value is reached. Examples arise in machine learning, graph traversal, and a host of numerical analysis problems which involve finding interpolations, extrapolations or regressions. The Python example below shows one way to achieve convergence using Pig scripts.</p>

<source>
#!/usr/bin/python

# explicitly import Pig class
from org.apache.pig.scripting import Pig

P = Pig.compile("""A = load '$input' as (user, age, gpa);
                   B = group A all;
                   C = foreach B generate AVG(A.gpa);
                   store C into '$output';
                """)
# initial output
input = "studenttab5"
output = "output-5"
final = "final-output"

for i in range(1, 4):
    Q = P.bind({'input':input, 'output':output}) # attaches $input, $output in Pig Latin to input, output Python variable
    results = Q.runSingle()

    if results.isSuccessful() == "FAILED":
        raise "Pig job failed"
    iter = results.result("C").iterator()
    if iter.hasNext():
        tuple = iter.next()
        value = tuple.get(0)
        if float(str(value)) &lt; 3:
            print "value: " + str(value)
            input = "studenttab" + str(i+5)
            output = "output-" + str(i+5)
            print "output: " + output
        else:
           Pig.fs("mv " + output + " " + final)
           break
</source>
</section>

<section>
<title>Automated Pig Latin Generation</title>
<p>A number of user frameworks do automated generation of Pig Latin, such as setting the proper date for data loads.</p>

<source>
today = sys.argv[1]
P = Pig.compile("""A = load 'fact' using HowlLoader();
                   B = filter A by datestamp = '$date';
                   ...
                   store Z into 'aggregated' using HowlStorage('datestamp = $date');
                """)
P.bind({'date':today}).runSingle()
</source>
</section>


<section>
<title>Conditional Compilation</title>
<p>A sub-use case of automated generation is conditional code generation. Different processing might be required based on whether this is weekday or a weekend.</p>

<source>
str = "A = load 'input';" 
if today.isWeekday():
    str = str + "B = filter A by weekday_filter(*);" 
else:
    str = str + "B = filter A by weekend_filter(*);" 
str = str + "C = group B by user;" 
results = Pig.compile(str).bind().runSingle()
</source>
</section>

<section>
<title>Parallel Execution</title>
<p>Another sub-use case of automated generation is parallel execution of identical pipelines. You may have a single pipeline that you would like to run multiple data sets through in parallel. In the example below, the pipeline is run for the US, the UK, and Brazil.</p>

<source>

P = Pig.compile("""A = load '$in';
                   B = filter A by user is not null;
                   ...
                   store Z into '$out';
                """)

Q = P.bind([{'in':'us_raw','out':'us_processed'},
        {'in':'uk_raw','out':'uk_processed'},
        {'in':'brazil_raw','out':'brazil_processed'}])

results = Q.run() # it blocks until all pipelines are completed

for i in [0, 1, 2]:
    result = results[i]
    ... # check result for each pipeline

<p>Currently, <a href="http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.9.0/api/org/apache/pig/PigServer.html">PigServer</a> is the main interface point for embedding Pig in Java.

   <title>Usage</title>
   <p>Parameter substitution enables you to write Pig scripts that include parameters and to supply values for these parameters at run time. For instance, suppose you have a job that needs to run every day using the current day's data. You can create a Pig script that includes a parameter for the date. Then, when you run this script you can specify or supply a value for the date parameter using one of the supported methods. </p>
   
   <section>
   <title>Specifying Parameters </title>
   <p>You can specify parameter names and parameter values as follows:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <p>As part of a command line.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>In parameter file, as part of a command line.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>With the declare statement, as part of Pig script.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>With default statement, as part of a Pig script.</p>
      </li>
   </ul>
   </section>
   
   <section>
   <title>Precedence</title>
   <p>Precedence for parameters is as follows:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <p>Highest - parameters defined using the declare statement</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Next - parameters defined in the command line</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Lowest - parameters defined in a script</p>
      </li>
   </ul>
   </section>
   
   <section>
   <title>Processing Order and Precedence</title>
   <p>Parameters are processed as follows:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <p>Command line parameters are scanned in the order they are specified on the command line. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Parameter files are scanned in the order they are specified on the command line. Within each file, the parameters are processed in the order they are listed. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Declare and default preprocessors statements are processed in the order they appear in the Pig script. </p>
      </li>
   </ul>
   </section></section>
   
   <section>
   <title>Example: Specifying parameters in the command line</title>
   <p>Suppose we have a data file called 'mydata' and a pig script called 'myscript.pig'.</p>

<p>mydata </p>
<source>

</source>
 
 <p>myscript.pig</p>
<source>
A = LOAD '$data' USING PigStorage() AS (f1:int, f2:int, f3:int);
DUMP A;
</source>

<p>In this example the parameter (data) and the parameter value (mydata) are specified in the command line. If the parameter name in the command line (data) and the parameter name in the script ($data) do not match, the script will not run. If the value for the parameter (mydata) is not found, an error is generated.</p>
<source>
$ pig –param data=mydata myscript.pig

   <section>
   <title>Example: Specifying parameters using a parameter file</title>
   <p>Suppose we have a parameter file called 'myparams.'</p>
<source>
# my parameters
data1 = mydata1
cmd = `generate_name`
</source>

   
   <p>In this example the parameters and values are passed to the script using the parameter file.</p>
<source>
$ pig –param_file myparams script2.pig
</source>
   
   </section>
   
   <section>
   <title>Example: Specifying parameters using the declare statement</title>
   <p>In this example the command is executed and its stdout is used as the parameter value.</p>
<source>
%declare CMD 'generate_date';
A = LOAD '/data/mydata/$CMD';
B = FILTER A BY $0>'5';

<em>etc ... </em>
</source>
   
   </section>
   
   <section>
   <title>Example: Specifying parameters using the default statement</title>
   <p>In this example the parameter (DATE) and value ('20090101') are specified in the Pig script using the default statement. If a value for DATE is not specified elsewhere, the default value 20090101 is used.</p>
<source>
%default DATE '20090101';
A = load '/data/mydata/$DATE';

<em>etc ... </em>
</source>

   </section>
   
   <section>
   <title>Examples: Specifying parameter values as a sequence of characters</title>
   <p>In this example the characters (in this case, Joe's URL) can be enclosed in single or double quotes, and quotes within the sequence of characters can be escaped. </p>
<source>
%declare DES 'Joe\'s URL';
A = LOAD 'data' AS (name, description, url);
B = FILTER A BY description == '$DES';
 
<em>etc ... </em>
</source>
   
   <p>In this example single word values that don't use special characters (in this case, mydata) don't have to be enclosed in quotes.</p>
<source>
$ pig –param data=mydata myscript.pig
</source>   
</section>
   
   <section>
   <title>Example: Specifying parameter values as a command</title>
   <p>In this example the command is enclosed in back ticks. First, the parameters mycmd and date are substituted when the declare statement is encountered. Then the resulting command is executed and its stdout is placed in the path before the load statement is run.</p>
<source>
%declare CMD '$mycmd $date';
A = LOAD '/data/mydata/$CMD';
B = FILTER A BY $0>'5';
