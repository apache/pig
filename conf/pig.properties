############################ SchemaTuple ############################

# Setting this value will turn on the SchemaTuple feature (PIG-2632)
# This will attempt to use code generation for more efficient within
# the pig code. This can lead to both CPU, serialization, and memory
# benefits (currently, the potential memory benefits are the largest).

# This parameter will enable the optimization in all available cases
#pig.schematuple=true

# Certain cases can be turned off by uncommenting the following. These will
# all be off by default, but will all be turned on if pig.schematuple is set
# to true.

# This will disable SchemaTuples in the case of udfs. Currently,
# the input to UDF's will be SchemaTuples.

#pig.schematuple.udf=false

# This is currently not implemented. In the future, LoadFunc's with known
# schema's should output SchemaTuples

#pig.schematuple.load=false

# This will use SchemaTuples in replicated joins. The potential memory saving
# here is significant. It will use SchemaTuples when it builds the HashMap of
# the join key to related values.

#pig.schematuple.fr_join=false

# In the current implementation of merge join, all of the Tuples in the left relation
# that share a given key will be stored in a List in memory. This will use SchemaTuples
# instead in that List.

#pig.schematuple.merge_join=false

##### Set up optional Pig Progress Notification Listener ############

# Note that only one PPNL can be set up. If you need several, write a PPNL that will chain them.
# pig.notification.listener = <fully qualified class name of a PPNL implementation>

# Optionally, you can supply a single String argument to pass to your PPNL. 
# pig.notification.listener.arg = <somevalue>

########## Override the default Reducer Estimator logic #############

# By default, the logic to estimate the number of reducers to use for a given job lives in:
#   org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.InputSizeReducerEstimator
# This logic can be replaced by implementing the following interface:
#   org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.PigReducerEstimator

# This class will be invoked to estimate the number of reducers to use.
# pig.exec.reducer.estimator = <fully qualified class name of a PigReducerEstimator implementation>

# Optionally, you can supply a single String argument to pass to your PigReducerEstimator.
# pig.exec.reducer.estimator.arg = <somevalue>

#####################################################################

###### Override the default Pig Stats Output Size Reader logic ######

# By default, the size of reducers output is computed as the total size of
# output files. But since not every storage is file-based, this logic is not
# always applicable. If that is the case, the logic can be replaced by
# implementing the following interface:
#   org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.PigStatsOutputSizeReader

# This class will be invoked to compute the size of reducers output.
# pig.stats.output.size.reader = <fully qualified class name of a PigStatsOutputSizeReader implementation>

# If you need to register more than one reader, you can register them as a comma
# separated list. Every reader implements a boolean supports(POStore sto) method.
# When there are more than one reader, they are consulted in order, and the
# first one whose supports() method returns true will be used.

########### Override hadoop configs programatically #################

# By default, Pig expects hadoop configs (hadoop-site.xml and core-site.xml)
# to be present on the classpath. There are cases when these configs are 
# needed to be passed programatically, such as while using the PigServer API.
# In such cases, you can override hadoop configs by setting the property
# "pig.use.overriden.hadoop.configs". 
# 
# When this property is set to true, Pig ignores looking for hadoop configs
# in the classpath and instead picks it up from Properties/Configuration
# object passed to it.

# pig.use.overriden.hadoop.configs=false

# Set this option to turn on additional jar caching for the user
# pig.user.cache.enabled=true
